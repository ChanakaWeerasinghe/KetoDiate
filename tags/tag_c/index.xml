  Triangulation and asymmetrical composition. Primary, secondary and tertiary branch identification and placement. Selection of primary viewing angle based on trunk movement and rootage .</description>

      <description>Bonsai Styles It is important for you to remember, as a beginner, that no single bonsai style is the “right” style. Bonsai is meant to be a representation of a tree in nature. Crafting a bonsai masterpiece is tantamount to how YOU view that tree. You are not learning from a bonsai master, you are simply being given instruction on how to create your own bonsai. What you make of it lies simply in your own mind.</description>

      <title>Bonsai Watering</title>

      <description>More Bonsai die thru incorrect watering than any other cause, with the majority of those caused by “overwatering”. When the surface of the soil feels dry to the touch, water the plant until entire root ball is wet. DO NOT water again until the soil surface feels dry again. This can be as frequent as three times a day or as infrequent as every 3 days depending upon several conditions including time of year, plant health, and soil composition.</description>

      <description>Buying a Bonsai tree in a shop is nice, but wouldn’t it be much better to do it yourself? A great way to start growing Bonsai trees is to buy a starterkit and style the tree into a Bonsai. A starterkit can be purchased at many (online) Bonsai shops, but you could also choose to buy only a young plant at a local gardencenter. This article explains the steps to grow a Bonsai tree from a starterkit.</description>

The depth of the pot should be the caliper of the trunk, except for cascades. Colored glazed pots should be used for flowering and fruiting trees and the colors should complement the flower color. The width of the pot should be 2/3 the height of the tree.</description>

      <description>There are many different soil mixtures used to plant bonsai. Bonsai people in Florida, Scotland, Holland, Japan, Canada and California all have different growing conditions and different materials available to make soil mixtures. Most mixtures have one thing in common &amp;ndash; they don&amp;rsquo;t use garden soil. This is because shallow pots don&amp;rsquo;t drain as well as soil in the garden and as a result the roots can stay too wet and rot!</description>
